One anti-aircraft gun was destroyed on the 14th. The battery came under continuous attack by Japanese bombers and heavy artillery on the 16th, when the plotting room was destroyed. The remaining armament was eventually blown up by its personnel on the 25th.<br/><br/>The site was used after the war for a variety of military formations, such as a Royal Air Force Radar site, but was abandoned in the 1970s. A youth hostel was established on part of the site in the 1980s. The battery ruins still remain as part of a hiking trail.",

Its armaments were taken from the batteries at Gough and Mount Davis. After its completion, the headquarters of Eastern Fire Command was relocated to Stanley from Devil’s Peak.<br/><br/>The battery was manned by the 12th Coast Battery, 8th Coast Regiment of the Royal Artillery. During the Japanese invasion, the battery provided artillery support for the defenders. The fort was the last stand, as the defence was still able to maintain an effective counter to the Japanese attack until early on Christmas Day, 1941. After </br>Governor Sir Mark Young (1886-1974) made the decision to surrender on the same day, the defenders of the battery surrendered later in the day when the news was confirmed locally. Since there was not enough time to destroy the battery and other installations, all the facilities were captured by the Japanese.<br/><br/>During their occupation period, the Japanese used No. 2 and No. 3 guns for coastal defence. They added a 4-foot shield in front of the guns. After the war, the British forces returned and removed all the guns in 1952. All that remained was an empty gunpit that became a base for satellite receiver in 1970. The site remained a military land until 1994 when it was handed back to the government.",
